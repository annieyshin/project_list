Personal Strengths & Traits
```
1. A veritable hodge podge of dynamic and endearing qualities. I am a caring and creative individual who likes to ask people about not only their work but how they are feeling and about their backgrounds. I assimilate easily into groups by deploying sometimes off the charts charisma, but always with a good sense of humor and an open mind.
1. Remarkable team player, focusing on thorough communication, clear objectives, and manageable timelines. I have worked on enough high stakes and fast paced projects that sometimes one must be malleable and other times firm in order to work best within a group.
1. Adorable and Friendly, I've left every job with life long friends and it's because I work hard, but also make a point to reach out and really get to know my colleagues.
1. Fast Learner, and you will see the value I add to everyday work life by picking up skills and being able to train others in turn.
1. Supportive, I love to jump in when help is required, whether it's helping review a big submission of work or fixing the coffee machine. I want to know how best to support everything and everyone.
1. Artistic, yet analytical, with a background in STEM and fine arts.

Insights from this project
```
1. Admittedly, I do not excel at talking myself up, nor did I figure out how to set up a project with the devise gem without failing a few times.

However, I feel like this is a good foundation repository for building a deployable portfolio site. Hopefully to be revamped and ready for use in showcasing my work while job hunting.
