Insights from this project
```
1. Admittedly, I do not excel at talking myself up. I typically get to know people around me as a social outgoing person, and bring humor and an open mindedness to each and every interaction. My strengths are many, across a wide spectrum of interests and abilities, but to write about it and put it into a portfolio or some sort is not one of them. Talking myself up, is probably one of my least favorite things to do, but I can speak to the fact that I try genuinely to be everyone's friend and acknowledge that people spend more time with their colleagues than their own friends and family. I strive to make every day feel like one where people are not alone and can seek the support and help they need regardless of the subject.
